However, I didn not let that setback stop me from pursuing my dreams. I knew I had a passion for technology and decided to explore that avenue. That's when I came across CodeFactory, quite famous institution that offered a course in Front End development. I was initially hesitant to take the course because I had no prior experience in coding, but I decided to give it a try anyway. And boy, am I glad I did! The course was challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. I learned how to code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I loved every minute of it. After completing the course, I was offered a job as a Front End developer at a local software company. I couldn't believe it! All my hard work had paid off and I was finally doing something that I loved. As I sit here today, I am filled with a sense of happiness and contentment. I never thought I would be a Front End developer, but here I am, living proof that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. I am grateful for CodeFactory and the opportunities it has given me. I am also grateful for my cerebral palsy, which has taught me to be resilient and never give up on my dreams.Since completing the course, I have continued to apply the principles and techniques that I learned at CodeFactory in my day-to-day work at Spotify. The course not only taught me how to code but also how to approach problem-solving in a systematic and efficient way. I have also been able to build on the foundation I gained at CodeFactory by exploring new technologies and frameworks on my own. The course gave me the confidence and skills to take my career in the direction I wanted and has been instrumental in helping me to achieve my goals. Overall, I am incredibly grateful for the experience I had at CodeFactory and the impact it has had on my life and career."
